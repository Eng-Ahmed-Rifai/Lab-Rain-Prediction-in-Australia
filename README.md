# Rainfall Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This project is part of the "Machine Learning with Python IBM" course and serves as an opportunity to apply machine learning skills learned over five weeks. The goal is to build a classifier to predict whether there will be rain the following day using a rainfall dataset from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from [here](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ML0101EN-SkillUp/labs/ML-FinalAssignment/Weather_Data.csv).

## Algorithms Used

The following machine learning algorithms were implemented in this project:

1. Linear Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3. Decision Trees
4. Logistic Regression
5. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Evaluation Metrics

The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

1. Accuracy Score
2. Jaccard Index
3. F1-Score
4. LogLoss
5. Mean Absolute Error
6. Mean Squared Error
7. R2-Score

## Notebook

The notebook and related files for this project can be found in the GitHub repository [Lab-Rain-Prediction-in-Australia](https://github.com/Eng-Ahmed-Rifai/Lab-Rain-Prediction-in-Australia).

## Lab

For this project, JupyterLite running on the Cloud in the Skills Network Labs environment was utilized.
